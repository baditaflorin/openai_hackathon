# Automated Podcast Production Pipeline

This repository contains a minimal prototype of a podcast production pipeline built with the OpenAI Agents SDK.

## Components
- **Content Curator Agent** – Suggests topics and guests.
- **Script Writer Agent** – Generates show notes and interview questions.
- **Audio Editor Agent** – Placeholder for audio processing logic.
- **Distributor Agent** – Publishes episodes.

## Usage
Install dependencies and run the example pipeline:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m podcast_pipeline.pipeline
```

### GUI
You can also launch a very small Tkinter interface:
```bash
python -m podcast_pipeline.gui
```
